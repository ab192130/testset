#Proj01
 Project that i develop for my future purposes

##Resources
 Express.JS
 Jade
 Mongoose

##Users
 Authentication system was made too simply. When user logs in, browser saves simple UID cookie as a user passport. Passwords are not hashed and salted yet. It is unsafe yet.

##Blogs
 Blogs contain id, author and content. HTML tags are supported within. X-XSS-Protection is disabled during post view, because browser ignored iframes after submitting or editing posts.

##Comments
 It simply processes with POST method and adds comment below the object. Blogs are only supported yet
